# alk-Dotfiles
Ever-changing _ricing_ and `*UNIX` OS configuration. Work in progress.

I mostly use _tiling-wms_, especially [i3-wm](https://github.com/i3/i3) and currently [qtile](https://github.com/qtile/qtile) (even though I tend to wm-hop quite often 'cause I'm curious of the other alternatives). For what concerns _text editors_, I'm a [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) user and I edit with [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) quite a lot too. 

**Colorschemes** are managed by `pywal` which generates them based on the wallpaper used. I use a simple **bash script** ([random_wal.sh](https://github.com/alcestide/Dotfiles/blob/main/random_wal.sh)) that takes a **specified folder**, cycles through it, selects a random image and applies both the wallpaper and the corresponding colorscheme. I start it at very QTile boot from my `.config/qtile/autostart.sh`.

## Configuration

- **Window Manager:** [Qtile](https://github.com/qtile/qtile)

- **Terminal:** [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
