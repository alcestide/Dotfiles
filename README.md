# alk-Dotfiles
Ever-changing _ricing_ and `*UNIX` OS personalization. Work in progress.

I mostly use _tiling-wms_, especially [i3-wm](https://github.com/i3/i3) and currently [qtile](https://github.com/qtile/qtile) (even though I tend to wm-hop quite often 'cause I'm curious of the other alternatives). For what concerns _text editors_, I'm a [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) user and I edit with [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) quite a lot too.

## Configuration

- **Window Manager:** [Qtile](https://github.com/qtile/qtile) 

- **Shell:** [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) + [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

- **Terminal:** [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)

- **GTK Theme:** [Sweet Dark](https://github.com/EliverLara/Sweet)
